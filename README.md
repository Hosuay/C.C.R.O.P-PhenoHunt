# C.C.R.O.P-PhenoHunt
# Pheno-Hunting for Cannabis — ML Prototype

Purpose: Provide a reproducible Colab notebook that trains models mapping cannabinoid & terpene profiles (and optional genotype features) to therapeutic-effect labels. This is research-only; no cultivation or lab instructions are provided.

Contents:
- `notebooks/PhenoHunt_Colab.ipynb` — Google Colab ready notebook (copy/paste content from the project root or run directly in Colab).
- `DATA_SOURCES.md` — list of datasets and licenses.
- `MODEL_CARD.md` — model card describing intended use, limitations, and safety.

How to run locally / in Colab:
1. Open the Colab notebook and paste the notebook contents.
2. Upload your lab CSV(s) or enable the demo mode to test with synthetic/sample data.
3. If you want genotype modeling, upload VCF(s) and follow the genotype pipeline cells.
