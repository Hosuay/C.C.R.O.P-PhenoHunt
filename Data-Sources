Data Sources
Leafly Cannabis Strain Profiles
Source: https://www.leafly.com/strains
Used for real-world cannabinoid and terpene data scraping (THC, CBD, Myrcene, etc.).
Chemical composition patterns were referenced to simulate realistic cannabinoid–terpene distributions.

Kaggle Dataset: Leafly Cannabis Strains Metadata
Dataset: gthrosa/leafly-cannabis-strains-metadata
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gthrosa/leafly-cannabis-strains-metadata
Used for structured training data and validation of compound ranges and strain naming convention.
