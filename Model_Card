# Model Card — Pheno-Hunting Prototype

## Model overview
Models map chemotype vectors (cannabinoids & terpenes) ± genotype PCs to therapeutic-effect labels (binary per-effect). Trained on available lab datasets; intended for hypothesis generation and to assist lab/clinical teams in prioritizing candidate chemovars for validation.

## Intended use
- Aid researchers and medical facilities in identifying chemovar feature-signatures that correlate with reported therapeutic effects.
- Support clinical/experimental follow-up; NOT for direct clinical decision-making.

## Limitations & risks
- Observational datasets are biased (commercial samples skew high-THC). See Smith et al., PLOS ONE (2022). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Confounding due to growth environment, analytic method, and labeling inconsistencies.
- Model outputs are hypotheses — require wet-lab / clinical validation.

## Safety & ethics
- Use only legally obtained, properly licensed data.
- If using patient outcomes, ensure de-identification and IRB/HIPAA compliance.
- Provide model card, versioning, and provenance for every released model.
